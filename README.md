# Home Automation on the Cheap

The goal was to control a power socket with an Android phone. The cheapest option found was to use an Arduino module and a standard radio controlled sockets available at about 12 PLN (4 USD) each. A phone connects to Arduino over Bluetooth, and the controller switches the power sockets over 433 MHz.

For now, the application can switch the power on and off on demand, and at the given time on everyday basis. The source code is available here and naturally can be adapted to some other needs as another schedule, or to additional sensors of rain or daylight for example.
